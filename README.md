**MoFASA Tools** is a research-driven application designed to help researchers analyze human-robot interaction (HRI) using the **MOFASA (Modified Factors of Social Appropriateness)** framework. It enables structured analysis of participant behavior by mapping their decisions to the framework‚Äôs three central dimensions: **Identity**, **Situation**, and **Definition of the Situation**.

This platform supports the full lifecycle of an HRI study‚Äîcreating projects, collecting participant responses, and generating LLM-powered behavioral summaries grounded in socio-technical theory.

## Core Purpose

The app translates raw participant data into concise summaries using a locally run LLM, providing structured insights about:
- **Social Identity** (e.g., background, experience, self-perception)
- **Contextual Situation** (e.g., environment, time, type of robot)
- **Definition of the Situation** (e.g., uncertainty, social expectations, emotional state)

These insights are crucial for identifying how people perceive and act in robot-embedded environments.
